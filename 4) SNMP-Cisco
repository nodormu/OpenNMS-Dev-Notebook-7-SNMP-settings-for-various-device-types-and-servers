Here are a set of commands for most Cisco IOS based routers, switches and hubs.
SNMPv3 settings show both options for having both authUser and authPriv user commands.

SNMPv2c settings:
------------------
snmp-server community "custom community string" RO
snmp-server enable traps
snmp-server host "IP address of OpenNMS server" version 2c "custom community string"



SNMPv3 settings:
-----------------
snmp-server view ViewDefault
snmp-server group "snmpv3 group name" auth
snmp-server group "snmpv3 group name" priv
snmp-server user "authUser name" "snmpv3 group name" auth sha "authUser password" priv aes 128 "privacy password"
snmp-server host "ip address of OpenNMS server" version 3 auth "authName"
snmp-server host "ip address of OpenNMS server" version 3 priv "privName"




Cisco Nexus and related storage fiber switches SNMPv3 uses roles because they can be used as groups in SNMP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
snmp-server user "authUser name" network-admin v3 auth sha "authUser password" priv aes 128 "privacy password"



Cisco ASA Firewalls SNMPv3:
--------------------------
snmp-server group "snmpv3 group name" v3 priv
snmp-server user "authUser name" "snmpv3 group name" v3 auth sha "authUser password" priv aes 128 "privacy password"
snmp-server host mgmt "ip address of OpenNMS server" version 3 "authUser name"


Notes:
------
You might have specify an interface or sub interface depending on how your router or switch is configured.

snmp-server trap-source "interface or sub interface goes here"

Also notice that the example in the level of encryption for aes in the SNMPv3 settings is 128. You could also set 192 or 256.
