Here are some snmpwalk command syntax examples for testing responses.

SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c example:
---------------------------
snmpwalk -v 2c -c "custom community string" "IP address of device/server"


SNMPv3 example:
---------------
snmpwalk -v3 -l authPriv -u "authUser name" -a SHA -A "authUser password" -x AES -X "privacy password" "IP address of device server"


Notes:
------
If your device doesn't support SHA, then use MD5 for authentication.
If your device doesn't support AES, then it likely supports DES.
